# SAVE CITATIONS

For my first ever coding project, I decided to do a python program that automates saving citations into an excel sheet.

* Specifically, the program allows you to insert as many citation as you'd like and save each citation into an excel sheet. 

  * As it saves the citation, it breaks each citation down into the author, publication year, and title.

  * It also allows you to search for the citation on Google Scholar, if you want to.

*There is some setup tasks you need to do before getting started. So, make sure you read notes, which I provided in the program itself.*

# MY INSPIRATION

* As a someone who reads a lot of academic works, I always end up with one big problem. 

  * I would read a journal article, find it helpful to my project, and go to its reference list to see what other works I can check out. 

  * But I have no way of storing the citations for works that I think might be relevant. 

* So, what happens? 
  * I would open a new tab and search for each presumably relevant work on Google Scholar just so I can have a way of getting back to each of them later

...Not very efficient and organized. 

The program solves this issue, and I use it in conjunction with Zotero.
