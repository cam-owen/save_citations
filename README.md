# SAVE CITATIONS

For my first ever coding project, I decided to do a python program that automates saving citations into an excel sheet.

Specifically, the program allows you to insert as many citations as you'd like and save each citation into an excel sheet. 

As it saves the citations, it breaks them down into the author, publication year, and title.

It also allows you to search for the citation on Google Scholar, if you want to.

*There is some setup tasks you need to do before getting started. So, make sure you read notes, which I provided in the program itself.*

# MY INSPIRATION

* As a someone who reads a lot of academic works, I always end up with one big problem. 

  * I would read a journal article, find it helpful to my project, and go to its reference list to see what other works I can check out. 

  * But I have no way of storing the citations for works that I think might be relevant. 


* So, what happens? 

  * I would open a new tab and search for each presumably relevant work on Google Scholar just so I can get back to each of them later.


Not very efficient and organized...and I end up with a lot of open tabs. 


The program solves this issue as I can search for presumably relevant works in a more systematic manner or at a later time. And I use it in conjunction with Zotero.
