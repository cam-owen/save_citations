# SAVE CITATIONS

For my first (ever!) python coding project, I decided to do a python program that automates saving citations into an excel sheet.

Specifically, the program allows you to insert a citation, breaks it into a list of 3 components (author, year, and title) and saves this list into the excel sheet in the corresponding columns. 

There is some setup tasks you need to do before getting started. So, make sure you read notes from the program itself.
